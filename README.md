# React

This repository contains all the exercises, notes, and development I've done during the Complete React course provided by [Origamid.com](https://www.origamid.com/). The course was designed to teach you how to build web applications using React from scratch. The final project is a web application similar to popular social media platforms like Instagram, providing hands-on experience in creating reactive web applications.

The main objective of the course was to provide a comprehensive understanding of React, which is why most of the course was focused on building everything from the ground up, minimizing dependencies on external packages.

## Main Topics Covered

- Hooks
- React Router
- useContext
- CSS Modules
- PropTypes
- Functional Component
- Properties
- Events
- React
- JavaScript
